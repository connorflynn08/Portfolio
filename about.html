    <div class="contenttwo">Hi, my name is Connor Flynn, and this is a portfolio of my web development work.
      Currently, this site is is static, with no use of database integration or scripting, but that will change
      once I've learned more. At this time, my knowledge of coding is mainly structured around web page builds using
      HTML, CSS, and SASS. I also have some knowledge in Javascript.<br><br> My previous occupations were all situated
      around the trade industry. I've worked as a Rope Access Technician, and most recently as an electrician.<br><br>
      I have a strong knowledge of computers and have been interested in them since a child. I built my first PC when I
      was 12, and have a strong passion for all things PC related.<br><br>
      In my downtime, I like to surf (admittedly, poorly), play PC games, and hang out with my dog, Charlie.<br><br>
      If you'd like to have a look at more of my credentials, I'll leave some links to view my resume.
