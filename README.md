# Description of website

**Purpose:** The purpose of this website is to showcase my work as a Web Developer, and highlight my skills and knowledge through the use of an interactive website

**Functionality/Features:** The website landing page is open ended, with a nav bar up the top, that leads to all of the children pages. You can access all pages from all pages. The site features a common font, colour and general aesthetic. It has interactive icons and links that will take you to external sites where more information is held.

**Target audience:** The target audience is mainly potential employers, whether that be clients employing me to build them a website, or companies looking to see what I'm capable of creating in order to be employed.

**Tech stack:** The website utilises HTML and CSS. It is a static website with some functionality, and will continue to expand in coding languages once I've furthered my studies.
